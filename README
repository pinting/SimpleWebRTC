## TalkJS

Check out the official client: http://talk.pinting.hu

The base of the library is written by Henrik Joreteg, and I updated it with a bunch of fixes and features. Still, there is a lot of things left to do. This is just the client side library, and it can only communicate with the official server: it may work with other signalling servers, however the private messaging system will be surly unusable.
