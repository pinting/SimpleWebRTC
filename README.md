# TalkJS

TalkJS is a P2P data transfer helper library: it relies on the WebRTC protocol. Its main goal is to communicate without a central point: so it is not just fast, but secure and it can reduce server usage. It can serve many purposes: starting from games, to chat services. All can be done with a single library. It is fast to learn and easy to use.

## Usage

`npm install`: Install dependencies

`grunt`: Build the library

`grunt bump`: Bump the version
