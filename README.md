# TalkJS

TalkJS is a P2P data transfer helper library: it relies on the WebRTC protocol. Its main goal is communication without a central point: so it is not just fast, but secure and it can reduce server usage. It can serve many purposes: starting from games, to chat services. All can be done with a single library. It is fast to learn and easy to use.
